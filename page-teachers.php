                    <h3>Alice Greminger</h3>
                    <h4>Cello</h4>
                    <p> Alice Greminger has been teaching Suzuki cello for over thirty years.  After learning about Suzuki Talent Education in her string education class at the University of Michigan, she immediately enrolled and studied with many of the leading Suzuki teachers. 
                         After Alice studied cello with Rafaele Altweg of the Academy of Music in Zurich, Switzerland and received her Bachelor and Master degrees in strings from the University of Michigan, she developed the Ann Arbor Suzuki Institute's cello program.  
                        During this time she directed strings and orchestras at the Manchester Public Schools.  Action lessons in string plaiying workshops with violinist Paul Rolland and cellists Margaret Rowell and Irene Sharp brought Alicé to England and her first lessons in the Alexander Technique.  
                        To expand her career, Alice completed a four-year teacher training program in Philadelphia to familiarize her students with Alexander's freedom of movement, an approach that improves technique, expression, and balance.  This amazing technique helps students ages three and up to seniors.  
                        Ms. Greminger has taught the Alexander Technique in the Music Camps of the Superior String Alliance and at the Meadowmount School of Music.  She also leads workshops such as the Alexander Technique as Movement Medicine for the Michigan Music Teachers Association.  Alice Gremin has played with many ensembles, including the Oriana Baroque Ensemble and the Superior String Alliance Orchestra and Chamber Ensembles.  
                        She loves solo concerts and currently performs with the Westside Trio and plays in Ann Arbor Kirtan.  In addition to her private studio, Alice has been teaching Emerson SNhoof's after-school music program since 2009. </p>
